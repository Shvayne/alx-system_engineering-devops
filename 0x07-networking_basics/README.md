# 0x07 Networking Basics

This project covers the fundamentals of networking, including concepts, protocols, and tools used in computer networks.

## Topics Covered

- OSI Model
- LAN (Local Area Network)
- WAN (Wide Area Network)
- Internet
- IP Address
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) / UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- Ports
- SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS Port Numbers
- ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
- Subnet
- IPv6

## Description

In this project, we explore the OSI model and its layers, the difference between LANs and WANs, the functioning of the Internet, the significance of IP addresses, and the role of TCP and UDP in data transfer. Additionally, we delve into the concept of ports and learn about commonly used port numbers for services like SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS. The project also introduces ICMP for network troubleshooting and discusses subnets and the rationale behind the creation of IPv6.
